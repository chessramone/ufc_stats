# Time for a real plan
I want to compare the current index.html file to the one I would request from ufcstats.com


If they are different, download the new one
else, pass on literally any further work (we already did it).

If we download a new index.html, we need to scrape the:
- event details
- fight details
- fighter details
in that order!
(This functinality fortunatle works)

Once we've done that - we update the db:
- events
- roster
- fights
- rounds
- results
in that order!

then we write one function that calls all the necessary functions!
